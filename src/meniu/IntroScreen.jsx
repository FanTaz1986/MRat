          Erif had a beloved pet rat named Snape, whom she loved very much. One day, she went for a walk with her rat and fell into a strange pit, at the bottom of which was a portal to a world that was not quite like ours. She heard an evil laugh and realized she had fallen into the trap of some kind of monster. But she was a strong and independent girl who was not afraidâ€”instead, she decided to defeat this villain and return home.<br /><br />
          Your journey starts now. Will you rise to the challenge?
